I have presented my project [QtRvSim Web Evaluation](../web_eval) at [InstallFest 2024](https://www.installfest.cz/if24) in Prague, Czech Republic. A conference for Linux and open-source enthusiasts.

The slides of this talk can be viewed [here](../if24slides.pdf) (English). The talk is also recorded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XQR8E8omCE&list=PLub6xBWO8gV8AG4kBn5W-QkMnTcdAPqvn&index=7) (Czech). An article about it can also be found on [root.cz](https://www.root.cz/clanky/kurz-preziti-s-linuxem-otevreny-hardware-meni-spolecnost-a-tucnak-v-telefonu-zapisky-z-installfestu/galerie-24334-106/#h22).

The conference has also been attended by Mitch Altman, the co-founder of Noisebridge hackerspace, and the inventor of TV-B-Gone, whose talk has been very inspiring.
