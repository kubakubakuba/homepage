# Energoplay

In the year 2021 as a part of team of 3, we created a project called Energoplay, an interactive game focused en energetics and sustainability.

This project won the 1st place in the national finals of [Energetická olympiáda](https://www.energeticka-gramotnost.cz/olympi%C3%A1da).

We then worked for about a year (during our spare time) on the project with the help of [Energetická gramotnost](https://www.energeticka-gramotnost.cz/), [ČEPS](https://www.ceps.cz/cs/) and [FEE CTU](https://fel.cvut.cz), and released it publicly in the following year. An article about the project can be found [here](https://fel.cvut.cz/cs/aktualne/novinky/31277-studenti-vytvorili-on-line-hru-ktera-simuluje-vedeni-energeticke-firmy)

The project website can be found [here](https://energoplay.swpelc.eu/).

The code of the project is not available publicly, due to the state the code is in. I have not yet been fluent in git and clean code practices, so the code is a rather messy collection of PHP scripts I am not really proud of. If I rewrite the project and release it in the future (in Flask for example), I will update this page.
